     <p class="paragraf">I bought one of the very last brand-new 2019 Premiere Volts last year.  GM had discounted it heavily, and in combination with my dad's GM employee discount and local state incentives, I paid just a hair over $20,000 USD.  I also got the faster 7.2 Kw charger, power seat, and other upgrades.  I mean, you just can't beat a deal like that.  I've had it just about a year now and have only put 6,000 miles on it.  I still love the car.  I also owned a Model-3 that I was renting out on Turo for a while, but just sold it since nobody is renting during COVID.  Some people were surprised I didn't sell the Volt and keep the Tesla.  But the Volt literally cost less than half what I paid for the Tesla and I like it just as much.</p>
